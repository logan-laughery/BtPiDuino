# Yeast Management

Some brief notes to help remember how to store and prepare yeast.

## Slanting
Slants are useful for shipping and short term storage.  (6 months or 12 months with distilled water or 18 months with mineral oil)

Building Slants
  - Prepare 1.005 gravity wort and heat in microwave.
  - Add 2% agar (ie 2g per 100mL) to wort and heat/stir in microwave until disolved.
  - Fill test tubes with enough of the mixture so that tubes can be slanted and have a slope extending from the mouth to the bottom of the tube.
  - Place in pressure cooker and sterilize (15 minutes under full pressure).
  - Remove tubes from cooker and slant to desired angle.
  - Once the agar has solidified, move them to the fridge and invert so that condensation can fall out.
  - After 24 hours in the fridge, remove caps and flick out condensation.

Adding Yeast
  - Flame loop and opening of yeast container and tube.
  - Cool loop in the yeast container and collect yeast (slurries work as a yeast source)
  - Streak on agar in a zig zag pattern
  - Flame tube and add cap loosely to allow gas to escape
  - Store at room temp until colonies form on the tube

Storing
  - Once colonies form, sterile distilled water or sterile mineral oil can be added to the tube.
  - Seal tube with electrical tape and store in fridge

## Freezing

Freezing is the best way for storing yeast for extended periods of time (3 years).

Storage Media
  - Sterilize 50/50 mixture of Glycol/Distilled Water and cool
  - Sanitize centrifuge tubes with rubbing alcohol

Preparing Yeast
  - Step up yeast to healthy numbers and then wash until clear of trub
  - Decant yeast
  - Add 50% volume of the glycol mix (ie 100ml of yeast needs 50ml glycol mix)
  - Mix and pour into tubes
  - Store tubes in freezer

## Propagation

Propagation is somewhat lengthy.  For most strains, allow up to a week to grow yeast to pitchable amounts when propagating from frozen or slanted samples.

First Growth
  - Prepare 10mL of sterilized 1.040 wort in test tube
  - Flame loop and sample tube opening
  - Loop the sample and add to wort
  - Add lid and shake to oxygenate
  - Loosen cap and store at room temp, shaking periodically over the next few days
  - When shaking, watch C02 produced and look for a decline in C02 output as an indicator that maximum growth has been achieved.  The first growth should produce 10 mill cells/mL.

Second Growth
  - Prepare 500mL of sterilized 1.040 wort on stir plate
  - Add yeast sample and let it reach max growth
  - 75 Billion cells should be produced at the end of this second growth
  - Follow step up calculators from here
